This is a project for ECE601. The goal of the project is to use image recognition to determine license plates as cars enter and exit a parking lot and charge the owner accordingly. 


## Android App
### Requirements
Our Android app is not published to the Google Play store, so in order for you to run it you will need to install Android Studio.
We used Android Studio 3.2.1 for Mac OS (https://developer.android.com/studio/). If you are using Mac OS it is recommended you use at least version 3.2 as some of the Gradle dependences have changed since version 3.1. 

### Install
To install the app, you will need to clone the project to your local computer.
Then you can open Android Studio. 
From the launch page click open existing project and navigate to the "Signin" folder in the cloned project.
Open the entire directory with Android Studio so it can see all the required files
You will then need to launch the project using the Play button. 
If you do not already have an emulator Android Studio will walk you through the creation of one. 
You can also choose to plug in an android device and run the project on it. 

### Running
Once the app is launched on the device you should be on the Login page. From here you can use your credentials to log in (assuming you have an account) or you can click the button to sign up. Once the user is logged in they can view their info, change their info (still under development), or logout.
